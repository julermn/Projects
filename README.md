**Solutions of practical projects.**
### Find PI to the Nth Digit
The program generates the number PI up to the given decimal place.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/PI.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/PI.cpp)
### Find e to the Nth Digit
Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/E.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/E.cpp)
### Fibonacci Sequence
The program generates the Fibonacci sequence to the given number.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/Fibonacci.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Fibonacci%20Sequence/F1.cpp)
### Prime Factorization
The program finds all Prime Factors for the given number.
