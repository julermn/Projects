**Solutions of practical projects.**
### Find PI to the Nth Digit
The program generates the number PI up to the given decimal place.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/PI.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/PI.cpp)
### Find e to the Nth Digit
Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/E.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/E.cpp)
### Fibonacci Sequence
The program generates the Fibonacci sequence to the given number.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/Fibonacci.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Fibonacci%20Sequence/F1.cpp)
### Prime Factorization
The program finds all Prime Factors for the given number.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/PrimeFactorization.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Prime%20factorizations/PF.cpp)
### Next Prime Number
The program finds and displays prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/NextPrime.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/NextPrime.cpp)
### Factorial
The programs find the factorial of a positive integer N. It solved with recursion and loops.
- [Java with recursion](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/Factorial1.java)
- [Java with loops](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/Factorial2.java)
- [C++ with recursion](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Factorial1.cpp)
- [C++ with loops](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Factorial2.cpp)
### Happy Numbers
The program finds first N [Happy numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number).
- [Java](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/Java/HappyNumber.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/HappyNumber.cpp)
### Number Names
The program shows how to spell out a number in English.
- [C++](https://github.com/julermn/Projects/blob/master/C%2B%2B/NumberName.cpp)
